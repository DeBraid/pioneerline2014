            <h4>The power of point-of-purchase displays is increased with the use of special-shape Microfoil balloons.</h4>
            <p>They add colour and motion to any display to boost brand recognition and increase
             sales without the loss of floor space.  Contact Customer Service for price quotes.</p>
             
             <p>Pricing will depend on the number of colours, if balloons are printed on one side or two sides,
             and the overall size and shape of the balloon.  Normal minimums: 5,000 balloons per shape and per design</p>
